                     6 Things You Need to Know About Dogs and Jasmine Rice

If you are a dog owner or dog enthusiast who really cares about the pets, there is every chance that you have given thought to finding ways in which a dog's diet can become more robust and exciting. For many dog lovers like you, the possibility of feeding their dogs with Jasmine rice has come up quite often, so the question is, can dogs have Jasmine rice? The answer has remained a reassuring YES!  

 In spite of this answer, there are some important information about Jasmine rice that will guide you in successfully making it a part of your dog’s newly expanded diet. Introducing a new kind of food to your dog’s diet could be a risky adventure, so you will most likely want to know the possible negatives that could result from it. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the whole process, the crucial information you need to have, the possible, and how they can be avoided.  

Here are 6 things you need to know about dogs and Jasmine rice. 

1. The difference between Jasmine Rice and the regular rice 

You probably have seen rice serve successfully as part of a dog’s diet in many cases and you may stop to wonder why Jasmine rice should be looked at specially. Well, the answer is that Jasmine rice, even with its usually white colour, is different from the usual kind of rice. 

Firstly, Jasmine rice is always long-grained while white rice could be long, medium and short-grained. Jasmine rice (also known as the Thai-fragrant rice) has a striking and pleasant aroma which makes it stand out from the regular white rice. It could also appear in other colours like purple, brown, red, and even black. 

 2. Jasmine Rice Nutrition Facts 

The health of your dog is closely tied to the quality of food that is made available to them. Jasmine rice is one of such foods that your dog will need for proper growth and development. Here is why. 
 
 A half cup, or 90g, or 2.25 oz serving of the brown variety of Jasmine rice will produce the following nutritional results: 
·	Calories: 320 
·	Fat: 2 grams 
·	Cholesterol: 0 grams 
·	Sodium: 0 grams 
·	Carbohydrates: 35 grams 
·	Fibre: 4 grams 
·	Sugar: 0 grams 
·	Protein: 6 grams 
 
Other nutrients such as Phosphorus, Magnesium, Manganese, selenium, Vitamin B1, and vitamin B6 will be released in impressive quantity. What do these mean for your dog? 

3. The health Benefits of Jasmine Rice for Dogs

There are quite a lot of health benefits your dog can derive from consuming Jasmine rice. One of them is traced to the high calorie content that it boasts of. Just a quarter of a cup of Jasmine rice will provide 160 calories, and half a cup, 320 calories for your dog. 

With this substantial amount of calories and carbohydrates, which is just at the sufficient and appropriate level, your dogs will be provided with all the energy that is needed to have a long swell time. The fibre and vitamin content of Jasmine rice is known to boost the nervous system of canines. The fibre content also helps to free up the digestive tract which ensures that digestion goes as smoothly as can be. 

Vitamin Bs have a wide range of benefits for your dogs. For example, Vitamin B6 is responsible for glucose generation, the control of the body hormones, immune response, and ensuring the proper functioning of the red blood cells. 

Your canines’ diet is inadequate without phosphorus. A major player in the health of their bones, phosphorus helps proper bone development in growing dogs and maintains the bone strength in adults. Too much phosphorus can result to kidney damage, but thanks to Jasmine rice, your dog will get a safe amount of phosphorus in its food. 

Another nutrient that plays an important role in the well-being of canines is magnesium. Jasmine rice gives you nothing to worry about when it comes to the adequate supply of magnesium. Magnesium in your dog’s diet promotes the proper functioning of hormones, the nervous system, and enhances metabolic functions. 

When magnesium is not present in the proper quantity in your dog’s diet, many things can go wrong. Some of the effects of improper magnesium levels include, depression, lethargy, muscle pain and weakness, nutrient deficiency, and endocrine diseases. Jasmine rice provides an adequate supply of magnesium to forestall these effects. 

On its part, the manganese content of jasmine rice will ensure that you won’t have to worry about the toxicity that comes from both inadequate and excessive nutrient content. Manganese aids the digestion and conversion of food, the proper formation of the skeletal structure, and the proper functioning of the kidney and liver. 

Selenium is a crucial requirement for dogs, though a trace element (required in small quantity), it performs roles that are too crucial to be overlooked. An adequate amount of Selenium in the diet of your dogs will ensure that your dogs get the proper anti-oxidant protection which is a safeguard against diseases and proper hormone function.

Is your dog dealing with diabetes? Jasmine rice has low glycemic index of between 68 and 80, and jasmine rice usually falls below the 70 mark which makes it renowned for its efficacy in curbing sharp rises in blood sugar.  

One of the most talked about benefits of feeding dogs with jasmine rice is that it helps prune their cholesterol levels, which in turn ensures that they remain healthy and less vulnerable to a host of diseases associated with high cholesterol content. 

4. Jasmine Rice for Dogs: The Good and The Bad.   

Even after reading about the wonders of jasmine rice to your dog’s diet, it is quite possible for you to run into other dog owners with not so encouraging stories about it. The reason isn’t far-fetched. 

 Jasmine rice, just like every other type of food can benefit or hamper the health of your dog depending on how it is used. Jasmine rice is best served to your dog in moderation, otherwise, it may become a hindrance to their growth and development. Still, the answer to the question, can dogs eat Jasmine rice? is Yes! 

The major reason why moderation is crucial is because the metabolism of dogs isn’t nearly as complex and efficient as that of humans. While the human digestive system can handle high intake of Jasmine rice, that of dogs will find it quite problematic. 

Moderation could be an ambiguous term when you think of it. The question remains. What is moderate and what isn’t? 

Moderation could mean a lot of things based on the age, size, and breed of your dogs. For instance, what could be moderate for big sized dogs could be too much for smaller sized dogs. 

The safest way to observe moderation is to not serve Jasmine rice too frequently. You could also do well to not make jasmine rice the major constituent of the dog’s meal every time it is served. Try making it the secondary course at least for half of the time that it is served.   

Let’s see the possible adverse effects that Jasmine rice could pose to the well-being of your dog. 

 Why Is Jasmine Rice Good for Dogs? 

The types and quality of nutrients contained in jasmine rice are simply too beneficial to be ignored. Jasmine rice is the remedy for a substantial number of canine distresses especially stomach distresses like diarrhea. 

Dogs like humans will grow and develop better when they are exposed to highly nutritious food like Jasmine rice. Jasmine rice will help dogs to maintain a low level of cholesterol and as a result, stay above a host of adverse health conditions.   

 Why Is Jasmine Rice Bad for Dogs? 

Some jasmine rice could fall into the high glycemic index category of 70 and above. In this case, it could pose a risk of diabetes to your dogs. However, this can also be put in check by feeding your dogs with jasmine rice in moderation. 

 The starchy part of Jasmine rice which is a consequence of the high carbohydrate content has also been discovered to pose some issues to dogs. When your dogs feed on too much starch from the jasmine rice, they could develop stomach upset. You could contain this problem by draining the starch away from the rice before serving to the dogs. 

There have been records of dogs being allergic to jasmine rice. This can easily be noticed after a serving. Take note to observe any unusual behaviour or condition in your dogs like loss of hair, itching, or restlessness which are some common dog allergic reactions. 

5. How to Treat Diarrhea in Dogs with Rice Water

Many patients with minor issues like diarrhea could be treated safely and effectively at home. Diarrhea and indigestion are common issues for Canines. Pet owners can attest to the fact that Canines eat a lot of things they shouldn't. When they do, their gastrointestinal system acts up through vomiting or diarrhea, in response to what they shouldn't have had.

This tends to vary as it depends on the diet, age, and temperament of your pet. If it's acute, it's a sure confirmation that your pet is reacting to something it ate. If it's chronic, it's a serious issue and your vet should be contacted immediately.

Either way, your Vet should be contacted while you try to relieve them and make things easier.

1. Watch out for dehydration: It's very likely they will be dehydrated as they are losing body fluids through vomiting and diarrhea.

2. Withhold food for 12-14 hours while providing adequate amounts of water and rice water to drink. Skip this procedure for dogs with chronic illness, dogs under one year, and geriatric dogs. They can develop low blood glucose if they don't eat.

3. Slowly introduce them to solid food. Feed your dog bland diets like plain cooked rice and unseasoned boneless chicken.

4. Avoid physical activity, long runs, and strenuous activities.

Ensure you monitor your canine and take notes of important information that will help your vet out. Notes like:

1. Keep a count of the number of your dog's bowel movements.

2. What the poop looks like, is there blood in it?

3. Does your dog have fever, pain, vomiting? 

4. Has your dog recently had something toxic?

The warning signs that suggest your dog needs Medical Attention shouldn't be ignored when these symptoms persist after 48 hours:

• Black tarry stool with copious amounts of fresh blood (bright red) is the first noticeable warning sign.
• Loss of appetite.
• Marked lethargy.
• Frequent vomiting.
• Signs of abdominal pain, bloating, groaning, panting rapidly, or avoidance response when you touch its belly.

The immediate Care for mild dog diarrhea involves a simple home remedy we will discuss in a bit.

Rice Water

White rice contains active probiotic contents, that help the body reestablish itself, speeding the recovery process. Rice water is the creamy liquid obtained when you boil white rice in water. It's important to use good quality white rice like Jasmine rice.  Brown rice which has too much fiber in it does not make the stool firm, thereby speeding the transit of digested material through the colon.

Preparation.

To make rice water, boil one cup of white rice in four cups of water for 10 to 30 minutes (slightly uncovered) or until the water turns creamy white. Decant the liquid and allow it to cool. You can serve the rice water to your dog often unless she rejects it.

 You can also increase its palatability by mixing a teaspoon of chicken baby food or another flavor that your pet likes if it rejects it at the first attempt. Mix probiotic cultures (found in yogurt, for example, and are also available from your health food store or your veterinarian as high-potency powdered acidophilus cultures, which are more effective than yogurt for diarrhea) into the rice water you are serving your pet during the fast.


6. How to Feed Jasmine Rice to Dogs - How to Cook/Prepare It
It is quite common for most dog owners to feed their dogs whatever they consume. The long grain variety of fragrant rice, Jasmine rice, is not an exception.

 However, this should be fed in moderation because like other kinds of long rice, Jasmine rice has a similar amount of fibre, calories and of course, carbs. (Too much carbs can make your dog fat). My guess is that you already know this. So, back to the topic at hand, how to cook/prepare Jasmine rice for dogs.

Jasmine rice is like other types of long grain rice. The difference is that it gets softer and stickier when cooked. Cooking Jasmine rice for dogs is not any different from how you would normally cook some for yourself. Simply boil in water but, do not add seasonings or spices. This is because spice can be toxic for dogs and has the potential of causing stomach problems such as pain, diarrhea and gas. Therefore, spice is a no no. 

Just keep it simple and plain and I bet your dog wouldn't know the difference. 
As a piece of advice, before introducing any new food to your dog's diet, be sure to consult your veterinarian to ensure the food is safe for your dog.
