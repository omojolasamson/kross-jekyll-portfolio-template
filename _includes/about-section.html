        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="font-secondary paragraph-lg text-dark">
        I'm an experienced Software Engineer. I love creating applications with responsive, beautiful, intuitive, state-of-the-art designs. I have a passion for helping companies 
          deliver amazing digital experiences to their users. When I build applications, I prioritise scalability and target audience. I'm a sucker for testing, so I only ship 
          bug-free, safe-to-deploy applications.
         I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ionic, React, PHP, Laravel, and Flutter. I'm also a technical writer with decent WordPress skills. I'm a
           team player and an excellent communicator.
